# Unclosed Paragraph Tag in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked HTML error: an unclosed paragraph tag (`<p>`).  Unclosed tags can cause unexpected rendering behavior and layout problems in web browsers.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous HTML code. The `bugSolution.html` shows the corrected code.

**To reproduce the bug:**
1. Open `bug.html` in your web browser.
2. Observe the rendering irregularities after the paragraph that lacks a closing tag.

**To fix the bug:** Ensure all opening tags have corresponding closing tags.  Properly nested HTML ensures semantic correctness and consistent rendering across browsers.
